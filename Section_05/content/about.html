      <h3>My Future</h3>
      <p>
        I want to create soloution for people with coding such as
        transportation, registration and also business too. I want to make my
        own AI to help on health science fields and make it easier for people
        that has a little bit knowledge about medicine easier to use and help on
        emergency times.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>My Interest</h3>
      <p>
        I am interested on technologies, historical, and video games. In my free
        time I had spent to explore about technologies and read article about
        technologies.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>My Point of View on AI</h3>
      <p>
        In my opinion, AI is just a tool like calculator to help on calculate
        math it can not be replace math teacher, so AI is also can not replace
        programmer too.
