        Default Container (.container): This is a responsive, fixed-width container. Its maximum width changes automatically at different screen breakpoints to center the content.

        Responsive Containers (.container-{breakpoint}): These containers are 100% wide up until a specified breakpoint (e.g., .container-md), after which they become fixed-width for that breakpoint and all larger ones.
